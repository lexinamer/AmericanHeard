        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>America Heard is a collaboratively made web series of short documentary films created by filmmakers across the nation in the wake of the 2016 election. Our goal is to feature the diversity of political perspectives from each of the 435 congressional districts.</p>

        <p>This election made many of us keenly aware of how much we all live in our own bubbles. We shape social media so that it reflects our opinions. We surround ourselves with like-minded people. We tune out those who don't agree with us. This leaves us in an echo chamber. But the reality is, everyone does not share the same ideas.</p>

        <p>It's vital that we start to hear other voices and film has the capacity to do just that. It can connect us to people in places we donâ€™t usually go. Through the amazing power of film, we have the opportunity to open up our eyes and ears to bridge political and geographic divides.</p>

        <p>We believe America Heard will encourage visitors to get outside of their bubbles by experiencing other points of view, one film at a time. We hope this project inspires our viewers to raise questions and start their own conversations.</p>
