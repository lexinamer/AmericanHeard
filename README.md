Basic development can be done by editing locally and previewing index.html in the browser.

This site will be deployed with Firebase static content server. Instructions for basic Firebase setup below:

The Firebase CLI (Command Line Interface) requires Node.js and npm, which can both be installed by following the instructions on https://nodejs.org/. Installing Node.js also installs npm.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the Firebase CLI via npm:
$ npm install -g firebase-tools

This installs the globally available firebase command. To update to the latest version, simply re-run the same command.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPLOYING LOCALLY COMING SOON.
